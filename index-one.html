<h2>Who is Jony Ive?</h2>
        
<p id="jonyiveintro"> Ive is a American designer. Johnathan Ive worked at Apple, where, for the majority of his time, worked as the Senior Vice President of Industrial Design and chief design officer. 
    He is known for his work at Apple and impactful designs throughout his time there. Jonathan Ive studied Art and Design at Newcastle Polytechnic (now Northumbria University) and graduated in 1989.
    He cofounded 'Tangerine', bringing his name into light for when 1992 comes around where Apple offered him a full time position, resulting in his promotion to Industrial Designer in 1997.</p>

        <h2>Industrial Design</h2>
        
        <p>Industrial Design, according to Wikipedia, is the professional practice of designing products, devices, objects, and services used by millions of people around the world every day.
        Industrial Design is the visionary act of determining and defining a product's form and features for the consumer, which takes place in advance of the manufacture or production of the product.
        Industrial Design's perspective takes a broad approach. For the most part, industrial designers, such as Jony Ive and his team, considered all users in all markets and considers the user experience and the products integration into the target market.
        The main features and rules of an effective, efficient and professional industrial design includes functionality, aesthetics, simplicity and innovation.
        Simplicity is very common across all of Jony Ive's work. Jony Ive designs are minimalistic, being influenced by the 10 principles of good design by Dieter Rams as well as in his childhood, he based his early projects on the German Bauhaus 1920.
        Other examples that follow these principles, being in the same branch of User Centric (the people who use, contribute and how they use products), excluding Apple products, are 
        Dyson Vacuum cleaners, where they addressed common pain points for superior performance, efficiency and convenience. 
        The next example is Nest Learning Thermostat, which learns about user behaviour for personalised comfort and energy efficiency. 
        Jony Ive used his professional ability in effective Industrial Design by combining the key principles stated previously to create user centric products that exceed use expectations, which therefore drives market success and enhances user experience. 
        This is shown by Apple's net worth growing from (according to Y charts online) $530m to $53b during Jony Ive's period at Apple, which is the economical impact his design has had on Industrial Design. 
        Jony Ive's impact on industrial design is revolutionary and changed the way design works for the future.</p>

        <h2>Style of Design</h2>
        
        <p>Jony Ive designed the first iMac that debuted in 1998 with an alluring rounded exterior in translucent candy colours, seducing more than two million clients that year.
        This computer was described as the computer for the millennium according to Google. With the design of the first iMac, it showed the tech world a diversion from the grey boxes that are designed on previous computers in different competitive companies at the time.
        The introduction of the translucent shell was a break through in technology design, all orchestrated by Johnathan Ive and his team of designers in the Industrial Design area.
        The iMac also allowed Apple to present differentiation as they moved away from legacy interfaces with the introduction of USB interfaces.
        According to StackOverflow, legacy interfaces are “the classes and interfaces that formed the collections framework in the earlier versions of Java and how now been restructured or re-engineered”.
        USB Interfaces were originally designed to improve efficiency in the connection of information to computers, replacing various interfaces, such as serial ports, parallel ports, game ports and other legacy interfaces.
        This allowed Jony Ive to impact the field of industrial design as he gained a competitive advantage and showcase his breakthrough with this unique selling point on the iMac in 1998.
        There were multiple products that Jony Ive introduced with the translucent shell, being the Ibook G3, introduced years after the iMac.
        The iMac showed considerable economical impacts on the field of Industrial Design; after the release of the iMac, Apple showed its first profitable year at the time in the past 5 years from that year.
        This was a turning point in maintaining that profitable year and improving/ increasing the net worth of Apple. Jony Ive has a strict design style.
        The design education Jony encountered at Newcastle University, the place where he studied, was based on a Germanic approach, according to Professor Penny Sparks.
        The Germanic Bauhaus of the 1920s was picked up by the British Design education in the 1950s. During Jony Ive's study, there was a foundation year in Bauhaus followed by a foundation year in British Design.
        The idea of these foundation years were that students started from scratch; they did not build on the past but started on an empty page.
        Jony Ive's design philosophy is very conscious of being minimalist; Jony Ive should only design what is needed also was derived from the German pedagogic tradition of Bauhaus.
        According to the British Design School of Art, Jony Ive interacts with service design, multimedia aspects, the packaging and the publicity in 1 strict manner.</p>

        <h2>Revolutionary Designs</h2>
        
        <p>Jony Ive created a multitude of designs that impacted the field of industrial design.
        The iMac designed in 1998 was the introduction that allowed Jony Ive to revolutionise the field of industrial design.
        This highly popular and highly profitable design allowed Jony Ive to design a variety of Apple products that would change the way the tech world operates.
        In a timeline of Jony Ive's most iconic designs from 1992-2015:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li id="ipod">2001 - iPod:
                This design was a brilliant concept as it was the blend of small size and great capacity with a simplistic interface of 5 buttons.
                The iPod introduced a stainless body in the tech giants repertoire, improving Apple's competitive advantage and dominance in the tech world through the industrial design field.
                The impact on the consumer was very good as the multitude of ways to use the iPod, being the ways to buy, enjoy and shop music, was a new and aesthetically pleasing design.
                The impact on the field of industrial design after the iPod was that companies in the same market were to create concepts similar to the iPod with having a collection of uses in 1 handheld device.</li>
        
            <li id="iphone">2007 - iPhone:
                The iPhone 2G was requested in 2004 and got designed by 2007.
                The name Project Purple 2 where Steve Jobs wanted consumers having an interactive computer with a multi-touch screen, removing the need for a mouse and keyboard.
                It was not the first smartphone made but it was the most influential and impactful on both the tech world but also the field of industrial design due to its complexity, aesthetics, and efficiency with its navigation in comparison with Apple's competitors.</li>
        
            <li id="macbook">2008 - MacBook Air:
                MacBook released its thinnest design, created by Jony Ive.
                Apple claimed that the 1.94cm thick notebook was the thinnest laptop in the world.
                The design was for mobility, with the target market being consumers who travel a lot, are in and out of the office constantly and are in need to a high value, effective design.
                It was announced that this MacBook was described as the greenest Mac ever.</li>
        </ul>        
        
        <blockquote>
            “We've built the world's thinnest notebook — without sacrificing a full-size keyboard or a full-size 13-inch display”,
            “When you first see MacBook Air, it's hard to believe it's a high-performance notebook with a full-size keyboard and display. But it is”. 
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        
        <p>In concatenation, Jony Ive, when researching about his impact on the field of industrial design, I am amazed about how well he has done for Apple.
        To start with, after only 3 years of graduating university, his impact with freelancing in the business Tangerine allowed him to be offered a job in Apple.
        From this, it only took 5 years to be promoted to industrial designer. His impact is very influential through introducing a translucent shell, the high value in the brand new iPhone and iPod, and the worlds thinnest mobile laptop.
        Jony Ive's designs are revolutionary due to the pattern of industrial designs followed over the years from his releases of the iMac and others.</p>
